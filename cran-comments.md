## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added on.exit(par(oldpar)) to plot_data.R

* Made sure users' par options are restored in vignettes and examples

* Made sure par is called as graphics::par within R functions

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
